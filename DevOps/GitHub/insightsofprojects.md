# Insights for projects

You can view and customize charts that are built from your project's data.

You can use insights for Projects to view, create, and customize charts that use the items added to your project as their source data. You can apply filters to the default chart and also create your own charts. When you create a chart, you set the filters, chart type, the information displayed, and the chart is available to anyone that can view the project. You can generate two types of chart: current charts and historical charts.

Insights does not track items you have archived or deleted.

You can also use filters to manipulate the data used to build your chart. For example, you can create a chart showing how much upcoming work you have, but limit those results to particular labels or assignees.

Historical charts are time-based charts that allow you to view your project's trends and progress. You can view the number of items, grouped by status and other fields, over time.

The default "Burn up" chart shows item status over time, allowing you to visualize progress and spot patterns over time.

To create a historical chart, set your chart's X-axis to "Time."
