# Automating projects

You can use built-in workflows to automate your projects.

## Using the built-in automations

---

Projects includes built-in workflows that you can use to update the Status of items based on certain events. For example, you can automatically set the status to Todo when an item is added to your project or set the status to Done when an issue is closed.

When your project initializes, two workflows are enabled by default: When issues or pull requests in your project are closed, their status is set to Done, and when pull requests in your project are merged, their status is set to Done.

### Process' checklist

1. Navigate to your project.
2. In the top-right, click ... to open the menu.
3. In the menu, click Workflows.
4. Under "Default workflows", cick on the workflow that you want to edit.
5. In the top right, click Edit.
6. Select whether the workflow should apply to issues, pull requests, or both.
7. Under "Set value", choose the value that you want to set the status to.
8. To save your changes and enable the workflow, click Save and turn on workflow.
