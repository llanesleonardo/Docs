# Github Flow

GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow.

## Flow's checklist:

1. Create a branch
2. Make changes (Create, Edit, Rename, Move, Delete)
3. Commit your changes including a descriptive message
4. Each commit should include and atomic change in your code base
5. Make a separate branch for each set of unrelated changes.
6. Create a Pull request (basically this is a peer review)
7. Address review comments
8. Merge you pull request (changes will appear on the default branch)
9. Delete your branch
