# Projects

Projects is an adaptable, flexible tool for planning and tracking work on GitHub.

A project is an adaptable spreadsheet that integrates with your issues and pull requests on GitHub to help you plan and track your work effectively.

Rather than enforcing a specific methodology, a project provides flexible features you can customize to your teamâ€™s needs and processes.

Your projects are built from the issues and pull requests you add, creating direct references between your project and your work. Information is synced automatically to your project as you make changes, updating your views and charts.

This integration works both ways, so that when you change information about a pull request or issue in your project, the pull request or issue reflects that information.

## Creating a project

Learn how to create an organization or user project.

Projects are an adaptable collection of items that stay up-to-date with GitHub data. Your projects can track issues, pull requests, and ideas that you note down. You can add custom fields and create views for specific purposes.

You can also choose to use an existing project as a template and copy the views and custom fields to a new project.

## Creating an organization project

Organization projects can track issues and pull requests from the organization's repositories.

You can also set projects in your organization as templates that other organization members can then use as the base for the projects they create.

### Process' checklist

1. In the top right corner of GitHub.com, click your profile photo, then click Your organizations.
2. Click the name of your organization.
3. Under your organization name, click Projects.
4. Click New project.
5. Optionally, in the text box under "Project name", type a name for your new project.
6. Click a built-in template, a template from your organization or, to start with an empty project, click Table or Board.
7. Click Create.

## Creating a user project

User projects can track issues and pull requests from the repositories owned by your personal account.

### Process' checklist

1. In the top right corner of GitHub.com, click your profile photo, then click Your profile.
2. On your profile, click Projects.
3. Click New project.
4. Optionally, in the text box under "Project name", type a name for your new project.
5. Click a template or, to start with an empty project, click Table or Board.
6. Click Create.

## Adding metadata to your items

You can use custom fields to add metadata to your issues, pull requests, and draft issues and build a richer view of item attributes.

For example, you can add the following metadata as custom fields:

- A date field to track target ship dates.
- A number field to track the complexity of a task.
- A single select field to track whether a task is Low, Medium, or High priority.
- A text field to add a quick note.
- An iteration field to plan work week-by-week, including support for breaks.

## Automating your projects

[Automating your projects](./automatingprojects.md)

## Exploring the relationships between issues

You can use tasklists to build hierarchies of issues, dividing your issues into smaller subtasks, and creating new relationships between your issues.

These relationships are displayed on the issue, as well as the Tracked by and Tracks fields in your projects. You can filter by issues which are tracked by another issue, and you can also group your table views by the Tracked by field to show all parent issues with a list of their subtasks.

## Viewing your project from different perspectives

Quickly answer your most pressing questions by tailoring your project view to give you the information you need. You can save these views, allowing you to quickly return to them as needed and make them available to your team.

You can view your project as a high-density table layout, as a kanban board, or a timeline-style roadmap.

## Best practices for Projects

You can use Projects to manage your work on GitHub, where your issues and pull requests live.

Breaking a large issue into smaller issues makes the work more manageable and enables team members to work in parallel. It also leads to smaller pull requests, which are easier to review.

To track how smaller issues fit into the larger goal, use task lists, milestones, or labels.

Issues and pull requests include built-in features to let you easily communicate with your collaborators. Use @mentions to alert a person or entire team about a comment. Assign collaborators to issues to communicate responsibility. Link to related issues or pull requests to communicate how they are connected.

## Make use of the description and README

Use your project's description and README to share information about the project.

For example:

- Explaining the purpose of the project.
- Describing the project views and how to use them.
- Including relevant links and people to contact for more information.

Project READMEs support Markdown which allows you to use images and advanced formatting such as links, lists, and headers.

## Use views

Use project views to look at your project from different angles.

For example:

- Filter by status to view all un-started items
- Group by a custom priority field to monitor the volume of high priority items
- Sort by a custom date field to view the items with the earliest target ship date

## Have a single source of truth

To prevent information from getting out of sync, maintain a single source of truth.

## Use automation

[Project's automation](./automatingprojects.md)

## Use different field types

[Project's fields](./projectsfields.md)

## Copying an existing project

You can use an existing project as a template by copying it.

You can copy an existing project and use it as a template to save time configuring your views and custom fields.

### Process' checklist

1. Navigate to the project you want to copy.
2. In the top-right, click to open the menu.
3. In the menu, click Make a copy.
4. Optionally, if you want all draft issues to be copied with the project, in the "Make a copy" dialog, select Draft issues will be copied if selected.
5. Under "Owner", select either the organization that will own the new project or your personal account.
6. Under "New project name", type the name of the new project.
7. Click Copy project.
