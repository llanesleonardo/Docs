# Profile & Managing users

## Collaborators

You can collaborate on your project with others using your repository's issues, pull requests, and project boards. You can invite other people to your repository as collaborators from the Collaborators tab in the repository settings.

### Inviting collaborators to a personal repository

You can send an invitation to collaborate in your repository directly to someone on GitHub.com, or to the person's email address.

GitHub limits the number of people who can be invited to a repository within a 24-hour period. If you exceed this limit, either wait 24 hours or create an organization to collaborate with more people.

### Process' checklist

1. Ask for the username of the person you're inviting as a collaborator
2. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository
3. Under your repository name, click Settings. If you cannot see the "Settings" tab, select the dropdown menu, then click Settings
4. In the "Access" section of the sidebar, click Collaborators
5. Click Add People
6. In the search field, start typing the name of person you want to invite, then click a name in the list of matches
7. Click Add NAME to REPOSITORY
8. The user will receive an email inviting them to the repository. Once they accept your invitation, they will have collaborator access to your repository

## Following people

You can follow people on GitHub to receive notifications about their activity and discover projects in their communities. When you follow people, you'll see their public activity on your personal dashboard.
