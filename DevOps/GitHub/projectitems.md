## Adding items to your project

Learn how to add pull requests, issues, and draft issues to your projects individually or in bulk.

## Adding issues and pull requests to a project

You can add issues and pull requests to your project individually, automatically, or in bulk. You can also add draft issues which can later be transformed into issues.

When you add an issue or pull request to your project, an event will be added to the issue or pull request's timeline. Timeline events will also be added when you remove issues or pull requests and when changes are made to its status field for those items. Timeline events are only visible to people who have at least read permission for the project. If a change is made by a built-in workflow, the activity will be attributed to @github-project-automation.
