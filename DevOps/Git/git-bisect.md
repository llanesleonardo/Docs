# git bisect

Use binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug.

The command takes various subcommands, and different options depending on the subcommand:

```
git bisect start [--term-{new,bad}=<term> --term-{old,good}=<term>]
	  [--no-checkout] [--first-parent] [<bad> [<good>...]] [--] [<paths>...]
git bisect (bad|new|<term-new>) [<rev>]
git bisect (good|old|<term-old>) [<rev>...]
git bisect terms [--term-good | --term-bad]
git bisect skip [(<rev>|<range>)...]
git bisect reset [<commit>]
git bisect (visualize|view)
git bisect replay <logfile>
git bisect log
git bisect run <cmd>...
git bisect help

```

This command uses a binary search algorithm to find which commit in your projectâ€™s history introduced a bug. You use it by first telling it a "bad" commit that is known to contain the bug, and a "good" commit that is known to be before the bug was introduced. Then git bisect picks a commit between those two endpoints and asks you whether the selected commit is "good" or "bad". It continues narrowing down the range until it finds the exact commit that introduced the change.

# Examples

```
$ git bisect start HEAD v1.2 --      # HEAD is bad, v1.2 is good
$ git bisect run make                # "make" builds the app
$ git bisect reset                   # quit the bisect session

```
