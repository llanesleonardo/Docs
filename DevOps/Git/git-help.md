# Git help

Display help information about Git.

With no options and no <command> or <doc> given, the synopsis of the git command and a list of the most commonly used Git commands are printed on the standard output.

If the option --all or -a is given, all available commands are printed on the standard output.

If the option --guides or -g is given, a list of the Git concept guides is also printed on the standard output.

If a command or other documentation is given, the relevant manual page will be brought up. The man program is used by default for this purpose, but this can be overridden by other options or configuration variables.

If an alias is given, git shows the definition of the alias on standard output. To get the manual page for the aliased command, use git <command> --help.

Note that git --help ... is identical to git help ... because the former is internally converted into the latter.
