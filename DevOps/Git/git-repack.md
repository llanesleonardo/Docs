# Git repack

Pack unpacked objects in a repository.

This command is used to combine all objects that do not currently reside in a "pack", into a pack. It can also be used to re-organize existing packs into a single, more efficient pack.

A pack is a collection of objects, individually compressed, with delta compression applied, stored in a single file, with an associated index file.

Packs are used to reduce the load on mirror systems, backup engines, disk storage, etc.

## Examples

In Git, a pack refers to a collection of Git objects stored in a compressed format. It is a way to optimize storage and network transfer in Git repositories.

When you commit changes in Git, new objects (commits, trees, and blobs) are created and stored individually in the repository. However, as the number of objects grows, it can become inefficient in terms of storage space and network transfer when pushing or pulling changes.

To address this, Git provides the capability to pack multiple objects together into a single pack file. Pack files store objects more efficiently by using delta compression, where the differences between similar objects are stored instead of duplicating the entire content.

Packs are created and managed automatically by Git, and you typically don't need to interact with them directly. However, you can manually create a pack using the git repack command to optimize repository storage or manipulate the pack files.

Here's an example of using the git repack command to create a pack:

```
$ git repack -a -d --depth=250 --window=250

```

In this example, the git repack command is used to create a pack file. The options -a -d specify that all objects should be packed, and that existing packs should be removed after creating the new pack. The --depth and --window options control the size and depth of the delta chains used for compression.

Please note that while you can manually create packs with the git repack command, it is generally not necessary for regular usage. Git automatically handles packing and optimization for you.
