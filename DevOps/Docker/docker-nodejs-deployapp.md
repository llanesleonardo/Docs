# Deploy your app

Now that we have configured a CI/CD pipeline, letâ€™s look at how we can deploy the application. Docker supports deploying containers on Azure ACI and AWS ECS. You can also deploy your application to Kubernetes if you have enabled Kubernetes in Docker Desktop.

## Docker and Azure ACI

The Docker Azure Integration enables developers to use native Docker commands to run applications in Azure Container Instances (ACI) when building cloud-native applications. The new experience provides a tight integration between Docker Desktop and Microsoft Azure allowing developers to quickly run applications using the Docker CLI or VS Code extension to switch seamlessly from local development to cloud deployment.

## Docker and AWS ECS

The Docker ECS Integration enables developers to use native Docker commands in the Docker Compose CLI to run applications in an Amazon EC2 Container Service (ECS) when building cloud-native applications.

The integration between Docker and Amazon ECS allows developers to use the Docker Compose CLI to set up an AWS context in one Docker command, allowing them to switch from a local context to a cloud context and run applications quickly and easily to simplify multi-container application development on Amazon ECS using Compose files.

## Kubernetes

Docker Desktop includes a standalone Kubernetes server and client, as well as Docker CLI integration that runs on your machine. When you enable Kubernetes, you can test your workloads on Kubernetes.

To enable Kubernetes:

- From the Docker menu, select Settings.
- Select Kubernetes and click Enable Kubernetes.
  This starts a Kubernetes single-node cluster when Docker Desktop starts.
