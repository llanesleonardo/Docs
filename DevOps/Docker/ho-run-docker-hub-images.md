# Run Docker Hub images

You can share and store images in Docker Hub (http://hub.docker.com). Docker hub has over 100,000 images created by developers that you can run locally. You can search for Docker Hub images and run them directly from Docker Desktop.

## Step 1: Search for the image

You can search for Docker Hub images on Docker Desktop. Use the search bar, or use the shortcut ⌘K on Mac or Ctrl + K on Windows. In the search bar, specify welcome-to-docker to find the docker/welcome-to-docker image used in this guide.

## Step 2: Run the image

To run the docker/welcome-to-docker image, select Run. When the Optional settings appear, specify the Host port number 8090 and then select Run.

Many images hosted on Docker Hub have a description that highlights what settings must be set in order to run them. You can read the description for the image on Docker Hub by selecting View on Hub or by searching for the image directly on https://hub.docker.com.

## Step 3: Explore the container

That’s it! The container is ready to use. Go to the Containers tab in Docker Desktop to view the container.
