# View activity and Data

You can view information about deployments for your entire repository or a specific pull request.

People with read access to a repository can see an overview of all current deployments and a log of past deployment activity, if the repository's deployment workflow is integrated with GitHub through the Deployments API or an app from GitHub Marketplace.

You can also see deployment information on the "Conversation" tab of a pull request.

## Viewing deployment activity for your repository

1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. In the right sidebar, click Environments.

## About repository graphs

Repository graphs help you view and analyze data for your repository.

A repository's graphs give you information on traffic, projects that depend on the repository, contributors and commits to the repository, and a repository's forks and network. If you maintain a repository, you can use this data to get a better understanding of who's using your repository and why they're using it.

Some repository graphs are available only in public repositories with GitHub Free:

- Pulse
- Contributors
- Traffic
- Commits
- Code frequency
- Network

All other repository graphs are available in all repositories. Every repository graph is available in public and private repositories with GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, and GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see "GitHubâ€™s products."

## Viewing a project's contributors

You can see who contributed commits to a repository and its dependencies.

You can view the top 100 contributors to a repository in the contributors graph. Merge commits and empty commits aren't counted as contributions for this graph.

1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Under your repository name, click Insights.
3. In the left sidebar, click Contributors.
4. Optionally, to view contributors during a specific time period, click, then drag until the time period is selected. The contributors graph sums weekly commit numbers onto each Sunday, so your time period must include a Sunday.

## Analyzing changes to a repository's content

You can see the changes to the content of a repository by analyzing the repository's commits, commit frequency, and content additions and deletions.

You can see all commits made to a repository in the past year (excluding merge commits) in the Commit graph.

The top graph shows commits for the entire year by week. The bottom graph shows the average number of commits by day of the week for the selected week.
